/** @namespace Magnum::Ui
@brief UI library

Widgets for efficient and simple user interfaces.

This library is built if `WITH_UI` is enabled when building Magnum Extras. To
use this library with CMake, put [FindMagnumExtras.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-extras/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumExtras.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `Ui` component of the `MagnumExtras`
package and link to the `MagnumExtras::Ui` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumExtras REQUIRED)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumExtras::Ui)
@endcode

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-extras repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-extras) and do the
following *before* calling @cmake find_package() @ce:

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_UI ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-extras EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
@endcode

Additional apps are built separately. See the
@ref magnum-ui-gallery "magnum-ui-gallery" app documentation,
@ref building-extras and @ref cmake-extras for more information.
